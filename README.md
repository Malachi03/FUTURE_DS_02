Data Science & Analytics – Task 2 (2026)
Customer Retention & Churn Analysis
By Future Interns

About the Project

This project was completed as part of the Future Interns Data Science & Analytics Task 2 (2026). The objective of this task is to analyze customer and subscription data to understand customer retention behavior, identify churn patterns, and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention for a subscription-based or SaaS-style business.

Customer retention analysis is a critical area for businesses where reducing churn directly improves revenue, growth, and long-term sustainability.

Business Questions Addressed

This analysis focuses on answering key business questions such as why customers leave the platform, which customer segments are most likely to churn, how long customers typically remain active, and what actions the business can take to improve retention and engagement.

Tools Used

Power BI

Dataset

The dataset used represents a real-world customer or subscription scenario and includes customer attributes, subscription details, engagement indicators, and churn status. The data was cleaned, organized, and prepared to ensure accurate retention and churn analysis.

What Was Done

The raw customer data was first cleaned and structured to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and incorrect data types. Customer records were organized to allow clear identification of active and churned users.

Churn rates and retention trends were analyzed to understand how customer behavior changes over time. Customer cohorts were created based on attributes such as signup period, plan type, or region to identify differences in retention patterns across segments.

Customer lifetime patterns were examined to understand how long users typically stay active and which groups deliver the highest long-term value. Key drivers contributing to churn and retention were identified through comparative analysis across customer segments.

Insights & Findings

The analysis revealed clear churn patterns across different customer groups, with certain segments showing a higher likelihood of leaving the platform. Retention trends highlighted periods where customer engagement drops, indicating opportunities for intervention. Some customer cohorts demonstrated stronger long-term retention, suggesting areas the business can learn from and replicate.

Business Recommendations

Based on the insights, the business should focus on improving onboarding and early engagement, as early churn was identified as a key risk area. Retention strategies should be tailored to high-risk customer segments, while successful retention practices from high-performing cohorts should be scaled. Continuous monitoring of churn and retention metrics is recommended to support proactive decision-making.
